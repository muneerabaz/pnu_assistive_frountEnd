My App is a way for the clubs to render and announce their Workshops , Events , group studies , competitions and anything related to their clubs .

It renders all the announcements that goes around that maybe not alot of people know about.

The students dose not have to sigup and he can't , acctually no one can signup unless i give them permission to which is the clubs , I have to make sure no random people announce random things .
